# a-class-above

A Class Above provides a basic OOP implementation, allowing
developers to create class hierarchies in angular apps.  Features 
include:

* Inheritable instance and class methods.
* Simple reference to super methods based on Prototype's $super implementation.
* "Extendable enumerables," which allow the creation of arrays or objects that
  can be appended to by each subclass along the hierarchy.
